# H1BView: H1B Job Title Insight Dashboard

Currently, this is a lightweight, interactive dashboard that helps international students explore job sponsorship trends by job title, using FY2025 Q2 LCA Disclosure Data.

Built with `Streamlit`, `Pandas`, `Plotly`, and `SQL`, this project serves as both a career research tool and a data-driven rÃ©sumÃ© booster.

Used Tableau to visualize the case status distribution across the US using a job-title filter and geographic heat map

## Purpose

**Why this project?**

Many international students struggle to understand which jobs, companies, and roles have higher H1B sponsorship potential. This dashboard provides a first step toward exploring this question using real U.S. government labor condition application (LCA) disclosure data.

> Note:  
> Although the project originally planned to **compare LCA filings with USCIS H-1B approval data**, the dataset showing the actual approval of H1B, this feature is temporarily postponed for the following reasons:
>
> - **USCIS 2025 data not fully released**  
> - **FY2024 and FY2025 use different selection rules**: a new lottery mechanism effective March 2024 significantly alters approval logic, which causes recent datasets to just represent a transitional trend
> - To ensure accurate, meaningful cross-source comparisons, deeper restructuring will be needed (planned for future phases)
